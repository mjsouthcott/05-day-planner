# Day Planner

## Description

This website quizzes users on their basic Javascript knowledge. Users have 60 seconds to answer 5 multiple choice questions. For each incorrect answer, 10 seconds is subtracted from the remaining time. After completing the quiz, users have the option to add their initials to a high score list.

This website meets all of the acceptance criteria specified by the customer.

2.  Once the quiz starts, a question from a randomized list will appear in the center of the window. Select 1 of 4 answers to move on to the next question (feedback will appear below the 4th answer notifying you if you selected the correct answer or not). Note that the timer will begin counting down from 60 seconds. Incorrect answers will reduce the time remaining by 10 seconds. If the timer reaches 0 before you answer the 5th question, the quiz will end.

4.  The High Scores page displays a list of initials and corresponding scores, sorted in descending order. The list contents are stored in localStorage, meaning they persist between quizzes (play more than once to see the list grow).

5.  Click the Clear High Scores button to clear the list and the Go Back button to return to the home page.
