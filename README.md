# Day Planner

## Description

This application provides a simple calendar that allows users to save events for each standard business hour of the day. It runs in the browser, and features dynamically updating HTML and CSS, powered by jQuery.

This application meets all of the acceptance criteria specified by the customer:
- The current date and time are displayed at the top of the calendar.
- The user is presented with time blocks for each standard business hour.
- Each time block is colour-coded to indicate if it is in the past, present or future.
- When the user clicks on a time block, they can enter event text.
- When the user clicks the save button for each time block, the event text is stored in localStorage.
- When the page is refreshed, the saved events persist.
